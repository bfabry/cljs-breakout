cljs-breakout
=============

Simple breakout clone in clojurescript to test out my workflow

.h1 Goals

Fast decent TDD at least for the core logic, with autotest
Fast automatic compilation to cljs
Play with core.async, separate i/o, presentation, and logic.

Run lein cljsbuilt auto breakout in one window, and a regular lein repl
with midje autotest in another. Best of both worlds and fast :-)
